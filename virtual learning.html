            <p>In our traditional classroom, we have a whiteboard where the tutor will be writing and explaining every piece of code before its executed. We also have a projector where you will be able to see the tutor write and demonstrate their code before you start coding. When you have a question or a problem you can ask the tutor and he/she would come and assist you</p>

            <br>
            <p>We developed a virtual learning platform that simulates how we work. We have a virtual whiteboard where the tutor will be writing and explaining every piece of code before its executed. We have the share screen where you will be able to see the tutor write and demonstrate their code before you start coding. As you are coding your screens will be shared with the tutor on their extra monitors where they can see every student writing code. When you have a problem or a question, the tutor would look at your screen from his monitor and be able to help</p>

                <br>
                <p>Project-based learning is a proven, alternative learning methodology to the traditional teacher-led lecture and memorization educational method. Rather than teaching a lot of theory and having students occasionally apply a fraction of their knowledge on a class project, we do the opposite. We give our students increasingly difficult programming challenges to solve with minimal initial directions on how to solve them. As a result, our students learn to look for the theory and tools they need, how to understand them, how to apply them, and how to work as a team.</p>
